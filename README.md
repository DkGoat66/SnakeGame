# Snake Game
## Overview 
This project is a Python implementation of the classic Snake game. The goal is straightforward: control the snake to consume food that appears randomly on the screen, growing in length with each piece consumed. The game ends if the snake runs into the screen border or itself. This version of the Snake game is designed to be simple yet challenging, providing both nostalgic entertainment and a fun way to learn Python programming.
